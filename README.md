# RecipeWebpageSample
A sample page for a recipe website.

I wanted to test out my knowledge of HTML, CSS and Bootstrap by creating a sample page for a reciple website. This page does not utilize any JavaScript so it is not as functional as I would like it to be but my goal was to create a webite that is responsive and changes appearances based on the viewpoint.
